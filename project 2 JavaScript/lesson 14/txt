The responsibility of the state for our health can be seen better from a distance. As the poet wrote (although about other things) - "...great things are seen from a distance). 

But since it has happened that we are not ourselves, that we are in some way NOT free because of this state, its laws that dictate our rights and duties, bear some responsibility for it, then the state must also bear responsibility for its citizens, and thus for the health of those citizens as well. 

After all, the state determines the policy in the country, the implementation of laws, the allocation of resources and budgetary funds. It determines control - how people live in this state, whether they have enough money for vital products, things and services. Moreover, the state collects taxes from these citizens. And not only income taxes (on individuals). 

The responsibility of the state for our health consists in controlling the implementation of laws and social justice.
